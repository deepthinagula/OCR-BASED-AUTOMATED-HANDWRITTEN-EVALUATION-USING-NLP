# 📝 OCR-Based Automated Handwritten Evaluation Using NLP

Welcome to the **OCR-Based Automated Handwritten Evaluation Using NLP** project!  
This repository provides an end-to-end solution for evaluating handwritten documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project automates the assessment of handwritten answer sheets or forms. By leveraging OCR technology to extract handwritten text and NLP techniques to analyze and evaluate the content, it aims to reduce manual grading effort, improve consistency, and provide insightful analytics on student or user responses.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Automated OCR:** Extracts text from scanned handwritten documents.
- **NLP-Based Evaluation:** Analyzes and scores responses using advanced NLP models.
- **Customizable Rubrics:** Supports custom evaluation criteria for different subjects or forms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Web-based input and results dashboard.
- **Result Analytics:** Provides detailed breakdowns of responses and scores.

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django recommended)
- **OCR Engine:** [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
- **NLP Libraries:** spaCy, NLTK, or similar
- **Data Storage:** CSV/Database (as per implementation)
